## About:
This is an assignment project for COSC2430 Web Programming offered at RMIT University Vietnam during Semester 2023A.

- Campus: Saigon South (SGS), Vietnam

- Lecturer: Mr. Tom Huynh

You are going to develop an online bookstore. As the first step, you need to create a static website version to get feedback from your senior developers. You need to build four pages in this phase.

1. Home page
2. Category page
3. Book detail page
4. Contact page

### Technologies used:

- Frontend: CSS, HTML
- Hosting: GitHub Page

### Supporting tools used

- UI Prototype: Canva, Codepen, Dribble
- Other resources: MDN Web Docs, RMIT Canvas, Sketchfab, Shapedivider
- All acknowledged in the source code

## More requirements for HTML

- Appropriate/semantic elements must be used when appropriate.
- Images must have an "alt" attribute.
- Headings must be used when appropriate.
- Form inputs must have labels.
- Rich media: at least one video is required
- Use "id" and "class" attributes. Use them consistently and correctly.

## More requirments for CSS

- Your website must be responsive: support at least 2 types of devices: mobile (width <= 960px) and desktop (width > 960px).
- Header nav bar: vertical on mobile devices and horizontal on desktop devices.
- Book detail page: for mobile devices, re-arrange the book images, price, and "Add to cart" button as the image below. For desktop devices, use the original image above.
- Contact form: for mobile devices, each input and its respective label are positioned on different lines (except the labels for individual checkboxes and radios). For desktop devices, each input and its respective label are positioned on the same line.
- Add custom font(s) to the website.
- Use CSS Flexbox to create more responsive and dynamic layouts.
- Use CSS transitions or animations to add interactivity to the website (e.g. For example, you could animate the hover state of links, or add a transition effect when an image is hovered over).
- Use CSS to style the website and make it visually appealing and usable (regarding layouts, colors, fonts, etc).
- Experiment with different color schemes and typography to create a unique and visually appealing design.
